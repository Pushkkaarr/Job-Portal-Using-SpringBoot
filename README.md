With the help of SpringBoot we Build a JobPortal for Freshers and JobSeeker's who needs new jobs and also for Company Employer's who want to post jobs in market.
Along with SpringBoot we have used following dependecies:
 1.Tomcat Jasper - to convert our jsp files into servlets
 2 Lombok - this redues code , and gives shortcut for creating getter and setter , also Construcors
 3 Spring-Web - as this is Web Application we need this API
